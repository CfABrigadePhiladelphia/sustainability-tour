This provided an excellent opportunity to apply porous asphalt.\n\u2022 Permeable materials, such as porous asphalt, are specially designed systems that allow water to soak through a typically impenetrable surface, significantly reducing stormwater runoff from a site.\n\u2022 Porous asphalt is as strong as conventional asphalt, but has voids in it that allow water to trickle through the material.\n\u2022 Benefits of porous asphalt include: extended life of the street, decreased need for salting and snow removal, and significant reduction in stormwater runoff.\n\u2022 Maintenance to date has been a biannual \\vacuuming, although PWD is looking into using a street sweeping machine as well. Monitoring includes two internal observation wells, six nearby groundwater monitoring wells, and regular surface infiltration testing. \n\u2022 Additional advantages of permeable paving include: higher visibility of pavement markings, reduced noise due to surface absorbtion, reduces the \"heat island\" effect and reduced snow removal requirements and less potential for ice.

After reviewing the perimeter of the site and meeting with representatives from PP&R and the Passyunk Square Civic Association it was determined that four planters would be installed along the length of 13th St adjacent to the park. \n\u2022 As a pilot project, the stormwater planters were designed to test multiple features such as the different inlets used to capture runoff from 13th St and were installed with soil moisture probes, observation wells, and an oversized control structure to allow for future monitoring and system testing.\n",

                "Description": "The stormwater planters at Columbus Square are the first of their kind to be installed by the Philadelphia Water Department, converting a portion of Reed Street into a Green Street. PWD will use the lessons learned from this project to refine stormwater planter designs and their implementation. The Office of Watersheds worked with Philadelphia Parks and Recreation and many community partners to design a series of streetside stormwater planters that capture runoff from the contributing street and sidewalk areas. A stormwater planter manages street and sidewalk runoff through infiltration and evapotranspiration (or detention and slow-release when underlying soils do not allow for infiltration). The stormwater planters benefit our streams and rivers by reducing stormwater flows into the overburdened combined sewer system, while benefiting the surrounding community through greening a significant sidewalk area and enhancing neighborhood aesthetics. In 2012, Philadelphia Water returned to the site to install a rain garden within the park at the corner of 12th and Reed. \n\u2022 PWD worked collaboratively with Philadelphia Parks and Recreation and the local community on the planters and rain garden, from design through construction.\n\u2022 As a pilot project, the stormwater planters were designed to test multiple features of green infrastructure. The two planters at the southern end of the block manage runoff from the street while the other two planters serve as controls to compare the success of the plants in the systems.\n\u2022 The Green Club students of Christopher Columbus Charter School helped maintain the plants when PWD first installed the planters and today, the Passyunk Square Civic Association has adopted the planters through the Soak it Up! Adoption Program.\n\u2022 The rain garden manages stormwater runoff from the park and the surrounding streets.",
