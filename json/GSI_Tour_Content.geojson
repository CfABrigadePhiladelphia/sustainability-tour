This provided an excellent opportunity to apply porous asphalt.</p><p>Permeable materials, such as porous asphalt, are specially designed systems that allow water to soak through a typically impenetrable surface, significantly reducing stormwater runoff from a site.</p> Porous asphalt is as strong as conventional asphalt, but has voids in it that allow water to trickle through the material.</p> <p>Benefits of porous asphalt include extended life of the street, decreased need for salting and snow removal, and significant reduction in stormwater runoff.</p><p>Maintenance to date has been a biannual vacuuming, although PWD is looking into using a street sweeping machine as well. Monitoring includes two internal observation wells, six nearby groundwater monitoring wells, and regular surface infiltration testing.</p><p>Additional advantages of permeable paving include: higher visibility of pavement markings, reduced noise due to surface absorbtion, reduces the \"heat island\" effect and reduced snow removal requirements and less potential for ice.</p>",
